# Machine Learning using JavaScript and Brain.js
In these demos, we use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS) to demonstrate some simple examples of machine learning.  
### Installation

Run the following commands in Git Bash or your favorite terminal.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cd1993/machine-learning.git
$ cd machine-learning
$ npm install
$ node index.js // or 'node index-lstm.js' for example 2
```
### Example 1 (index.js)
In this example, we demonstrate a simple neural network. 


### Example 2 (index-lstm.js)
In this example, we demonstrate a *long short term memory* neural network. We are also pulling the training data from a JSON file as opposed to using embedded data.
